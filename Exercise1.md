## Exercise 1: Initializing a Git Repository, Making Changes, and Pushing to GitHub (GitHub Website Only)

**Objective:**  
To practice initializing a Git repository, making changes to files, committing those changes, and pushing the repository to GitHub entirely through the GitHub website interface.

1. **Create a GitHub Account:**
   - Sign up for a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com/).

2. **Create a New Repository on GitHub:**
   - Log in to your GitHub account.
   - Click on the "New" button to create a new repository.
   - Enter a name for your repository (e.g., `my-project`) and an optional description.
   - Choose options like initializing with a README, adding a .gitignore file, and selecting a license (optional).
   - Click on the "Create repository" button.

3. **Add Files to the Repository:**
   - Click on the "Add file" dropdown button and select "Create new file."
   - Enter a file name (e.g., `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) and add content using the text editor.
   - Click on the "Commit new file" button.

4. **Commit Additional Changes:**
   - Repeat step 3 for additional files or modifications.
   - Create and add content to multiple files as needed.

5. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   - Go to the repository main page.
   - Click on the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS or SSH URL.
   - If necessary, set up Git locally and clone the repository (optional).
   - If working entirely on the GitHub website, skip the local setup.

**Verification:**

1. **Check GitHub Repository:**
   - Refresh the GitHub repository page and verify all added files and commits are visible.
   - Files should show content, commit messages, and commit history.

2. **Verify Repository Status (Optional):**
   - If Git is set up locally, use Git commands (e.g., `git status`, `git log`) to verify repository status and commits.
