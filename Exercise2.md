# Exercise 2: Creating and Merging Branches

## Objective:
To practice creating a new branch, making changes, and merging the branch into the main branch.

### Create a New Branch:

1. Go to your GitHub repository page.
2. Click on the branch dropdown (usually set to "main" by default) and type a new branch name (e.g., feature-branch).
3. Press Enter to create the new branch.

### Make Changes in the New Branch:

1. Switch to the newly created branch (feature-branch) using the branch dropdown.
2. Click on the "Add file" dropdown button and select "Create new file" or edit existing files.
3. Add or modify content in the files to simulate changes specific to this branch.

### Commit Changes to the New Branch:

1. Add and commit the changes directly on the new branch.
2. Use descriptive commit messages to explain the changes made in this branch.

### Merge the New Branch into the Main Branch:

1. Go back to the main page of your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button next to the new branch (feature-branch).
3. Review the changes in the pull request and ensure everything looks good.
4. Click on "Create pull request" and add a descriptive title and description for the pull request.
5. If there are no conflicts, click on "Merge pull request" and then "Confirm merge" to merge the changes into the main branch.

### Verification:

#### Check GitHub Repository:

- Refresh the GitHub repository page and verify that the new branch (feature-branch) is created.
- Check the commit history to see the commits made on the new branch.
- Verify that the changes from the new branch are merged into the main branch.

#### Verify Branches and Commits (Optional):

- Use Git commands locally (if set up) to verify branches and commits.
- Switch between branches (`git checkout <branch-name>`) and view commit history (`git log`) to see the changes.
